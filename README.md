# RollerCoasters-DataVisualization
This is a Data Visualization projects regarding real and game roller coaster. The goal is to analyze real existing ride from a technical and spatial-temporal perspective (how rides they are distributed in the country, how they evolved, …) and then compare real rides with coasters created in Planet Coaster game. At the end we will understand if game rides can exists in real life.

## **Involved Tasks:**
- **Analyze the real rides** present in the US from a **technical and spatial-temporal perspective** (how they are distributed in the country, how they evolved, …).
- **Analyze the game created rides** and understand what are the **factors that influence the most the rating**: how to build a good ride?
- **Compare the game created rides with real life existing rides** and understand the differences: can game rides exist in reality?

At the end we aim to **answer different questions**, for example:
- What are the factors that determines a good ride?
- How the height and speed of rides changed during the years?
- How the number of inversions changed during the years?
- What are the states with the highest number of rides and why?
- What are the differences between real and game created rides, if there is one?
- Can the game created rides exist in real life or game ride are not realistic? And many other.

## Main Steps of the Projects
1. Data Reading
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Real Rides Data Visualization
4. Game Rides Data Visualization
5. Game VS Reality: Roller Coaster Comparison
